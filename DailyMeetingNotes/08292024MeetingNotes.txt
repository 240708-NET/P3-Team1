-Practiced presentation
-Critiques from Richard:
--Shorten presentation
--Highlight containerization/DevOps
--Filler words
--Inflection
--Don't need to explain inheritance and other OOP concepts explicitly, just use the terms
--Don't need to explain lazy loading vs eager loading
--Use we as opposed to I, being inclusive to team
