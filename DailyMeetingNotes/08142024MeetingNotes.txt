8/14/2024 Meeting Notes
-Ned came up with goofy course names, teachers, and students

-Students should be able to add courses to curriculum
-Courses restricted by time frame
-Make sure functionality adding, viewing, and removing courses is there before time frame restriction

-Courses will likely have CourseID, CourseName, Prerequisites, Timeframe, maybe CourseDescription
-Course could be offered at multiple times, linked to Professor's table. Timeframe is also differentiated here (Different professors can teach the same course at different times)
-Profesor is ID, FirstName, LastName, CoursesTaught
-Students is ID, FirstName, LastName, and PreviousCourses
-CourseProfessorTime is sectionID, courseId, cprofessorId, and time
-StudentSection is SectionID, StudentID, and Grade

-Daniel and Ibrahim on front-end
-Ned on DevOps
-Josh on back-end

-Front-end will focus on making wireframe
-BackEnd will focus on making ERD/DB schema
-DevOps will suffer together
