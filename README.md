# Operate

## Docker Compose
To spin up a docker compose container on your local device, follow these steps:
- run "docker compose up" from the project's root directory
- the ui will be running on port 80 for http requests
- the api will be running on port 7262. Bear in mind, it will be running in a production environment, so Swagger will not work.
